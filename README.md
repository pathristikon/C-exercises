### C++ Exercises
The current repository contains different C++ exercises and intends to help students or proffesionals in learning C++.

The exercises were written during my personal preparation for the faculty of Mathematics and Informatics. 

### Usage for Linux and Mac compilation
If you use a linux system, follow these steps:
- cd into the folder containing the file you want to compile
- write g++ filename.cpp where filename.cpp is the file you want to compile
- write ./a.out to see the output in the terminal

### Usage for Windows compilation
If you use Windows, open the file you want to compile in your prefered C++ editor. Most of the times, the editor has compilator also inside. 

### Licence
All the sources are free for public and their scope should be to help in the process of learning C++.
